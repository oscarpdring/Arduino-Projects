# Arduino Projects Collection

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of various projects I've created using the Arduino IDE. These projects encompass a range of applications, including:

## Motion and Distance Sensor Projects
- **Motion Detection Systems:** Implementing motion sensors to create responsive and interactive systems.
- **Distance Measurement Applications:** Utilizing distance sensors for precise measurement and automation tasks.

## Data Analysis Projects
- **Linear Trend Analysis:** Leveraging data to uncover and visualize linear trends in various datasets.

Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and contribute if you'd like. Each project folder contains detailed documentation to help you understand the project's purpose, components, and how to replicate it.

### Getting Started
To get started with these projects, you'll need:
- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- Required sensors and components as specified in each project's README

### How to Use
